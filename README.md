### 👋 Hi, I'm Yara
**Developer | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | VTuber Content Creator**

### 📜 My Journey
- 🕹️ **2014**: Started creating basic games in Unity at 8 years old, using YouTube tutorials to learn C# (or the language Unity used at the time).
- 🌐 **2015**: Became interested in web development and began creating simple websites using drag-and-drop tools.
- 🛠️ **2016**: Learned CSS, JavaScript, and HTML at the age of 10, moving beyond simple tools to hand-coded web pages.
- 🤖 **2017**: Discovered the power of JavaScript and its ecosystems, diving into creating Discord bots using the Discord.js library and learning Node.js.
- 🎮 **2017**: Started creating simple games and scripts in LuaU for Roblox, sparking an interest in cybersecurity and anti-cheat systems.
- 🔒 **2018**: Developed what I personally consider the **BEST ANTICHEAT for Roblox**, tested extensively by top scripters in the community who could not bypass it. [Check it out here.](https://www.roblox.com/es/games/6872624242/MiguAntiCheatTest)
- 🎓 **2024-25**: Currently pursuing a vocational degree in **Microcomputer Systems and Networks** at 17, leveraging my knowledge to work on both private and public projects.
